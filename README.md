Student Score Prediction

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting student exam scores based on the number of study hours.
The dataset contains a simple relationship between study hours (independent variable) and student scores (dependent variable).

This regression task is useful in understanding how study time impacts academic performance and demonstrates the application of supervised learning in education analytics.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

Source: Student Study Hours Dataset (commonly used in ML beginner projects)

Format: CSV file (e.g., student_scores.csv)

Features Include:

Hours â†’ Number of hours studied

Target Variable:

Scores â†’ Exam score percentage

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas â€“ Data manipulation

NumPy â€“ Numerical computations

Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ Data visualization

Scikit-learn â€“ Machine Learning (Linear Regression, evaluation metrics)

ðŸš€ Steps in the Project

Import Libraries

Load Dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize study hours vs. scores

Identify correlation between variables

Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values (if any)

Feature scaling (if needed)

Model Training

Apply Linear Regression model

Model Evaluation

Metrics: RÂ² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Plot regression line vs. actual data

Prediction

Predict student score for given study hours

ðŸ“Š Expected Output

A trained Linear Regression model capable of predicting exam scores from study hours.

Evaluation metrics to assess model accuracy.

Visualizations showing the relationship between study time and scores.

ðŸ’» How to Run

Clone the repository or upload the notebook to Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook.

Upload the dataset (student_scores.csv) into the environment.

Run all cells in sequence.

View results and use the trained model for predictions.
